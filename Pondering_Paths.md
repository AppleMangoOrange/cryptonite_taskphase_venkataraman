# Pondering Paths

## Absolute and Relative Paths
This is straightforward for the most part. I learned some new terms like explicit and implicit relative pathing, but the rest are used in linux all the time. I didn't know that programs know the current working directory when the user runs it, but it makes sense.

## Learnt
- `..` is the parent directory
