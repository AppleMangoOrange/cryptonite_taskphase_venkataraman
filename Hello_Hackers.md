# Hello Hackers

## SSH

I am currently using Linux and have used SSH on a home server before, so the SSH part was not complicated. I made a new key and copied it over to pwn.college

## pwn.college

This is a new website to me, but it and the instructions it provides seem to be straightforward. Just SSH into the server the website hosts and execute the commands provided in the challenge. There are some folders that can be accessed by the `ls` and `cd` commands, but admin access has not been provided to us in the terminal.

## GitHub

I have been using GitHub for quite some time, and have had an account for more than 4 years now, so I have made many repositories before. Using the Git CLI is new. The [docs](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial) on the website are enough for now though. I created a new `Hello_Hackers.md` file, then `git add Hello_Hackers.md` and then commit and push the changes to GitHub. This also seems to be straightforward.
