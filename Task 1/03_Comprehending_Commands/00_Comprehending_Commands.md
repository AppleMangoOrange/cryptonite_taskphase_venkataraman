# Comprehending Commands

## `cat`
The `grep`, `ls`, `touch` and `rm` commands are commonly used and are learnt easily. `grep` searches for text and can be used to search the output of another command. `ls` can find hidden files if using the `-a` parameter.

## `find`
This is new to me, but it seems useful for the future. It can be used to find files in a specific directory

## File Linking
Symolic links are used on a daily basis. The `ln` command is useful in creating these with its `-s` argument. The `man` page of `ln` reveals that the `-s` argument is used to create symbolic links.
Hard links are more rarely used, however. Though, they are not used in this module.
