# Hello Hackers

## SSH

I am currently using Linux and have used SSH on a home server before, so the SSH part was not complicated. I made a new key and copied it over to pwn.college

## pwn.college

This is a new website to me, but it and the instructions it provides seem to be straightforward. Just SSH into the server the website hosts and continue with the challenge.

## GitHub

I have been using GitHub for quite some time, and have had an account for more than 4 years now, so I have made many repositories before. Using the Git CLI is new. The [docs](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial) on the website are enough for now though. I created a new `00_Hello_Hackers.md` file, then `git add 00_Hello_Hackers.md` and then commit and push the changes to GitHub. This also seems to be straightforward.
